		<h1>Beekeeping</h1>
		<p>The art of beekeeping has been active for centuries. The earliest known existence of bee keeping dates back to 15000 BC; people have housed and utilized bees for their honey since long before the birth of Christ.</p>
		<p>Beekeeping has struck my interest over the past few years due to family and educational influences. I have always loved honey and learning more about the creatures that produce it has been quite fascinating.</p>

		<h1>Interview with a Beekeeper</h1>
		<p>To indulge to my "hunger" for honey-knowledge, beekeeper Dixie Earl Glisson, Jr. agreed to answer some of my questions about a few of the basics of bees and beekeeping.</p>
		<p>Molly: What are the roles of a beekeeper?</p>
		<p>Dixie: Beekeepers have three main roles. Number one is to assess hive health and intervene when necessary. Number two is to provide space for colony to grow as the hive population increases. And number three is to capture wild hives to insure safety to the human community and preservation of bee colony.</p>
		<p>Molly: What part of beekeeping do you enjoy the most?</p>
		<p>Dixie: Eating the honey!</p>
		<p>M: Does beekeeping do anything to help the environment? Does this help society?</p>
		<p>D: 70% of the produce we eat, and most of the ornamental landscape in our neighborhoods, depend on natural pollination. Healthy apiaries make that possible as hundreds of thousands of bees head out to work every day, touching and pollinating flowering plants. As beekeepers, we assist in making it possible for hives to have "home stations" in areas where many flowering plants are grown and sold.</p>
		<p>M: Would you give me a quick run-down of the hive-to-honey jar process?</p>
		<p>D: Hive frames are set in a hive box, hanging vertically and close together. Bees build out wax cell comb from these frames. Once full, the frames are pulled from the hive boxes, and the wax capping is removed from the comb cells using a heated knife. The frames are then suspended inside a centrifuge that spins the honey out of the honeycomb. The spun honey drips down the walls of the centrifuge and is funnelled out through a drain valve and into barrels or bottles. I usually funnel the honey into mason jars or bear squeeze bottles to sell or use.</p>
		<p>M: What have you learned about bees that you wouldn't have otherwise known, if you hadn't become a beekeeper?</p>
		<p>D: The scout bees perform a complex dance across the face of the comb-called the Bee Dance-to show gatherer bees where food and water has been located. The dance actually reveals direction relative to the sun and distance from the hive entrance.
		<p>M: What are some common misconceptions about bees?</p>
		<p>D: That they are aggressive. Bees are by nature defensive, meaning they only sting when they feel threatened. They otherwise have no interest or benefit to attack. Their anatomy allows for only one sting, at which time they lose their stinger and part of their lower abdomen and they die. So, really, it's in their best interest to keep to their own and only get defensive if they or their Queen are in danger.</p>
		<p>M: What are the roles of honey bees?</p>
		<p>D: Pollination and honey production.</p>
		<p>M: How is honey created?</p>
		<p>D: Bees mix nectar with enzymes produced internally. Worker bees retrieve the nectar from the gatherers and chew and mix before distributing it throughout the hive. This process breaks down the complex sugars in to simple ones allowing the sticky substance to be easier to digest and less susceptible to bacteria growth. Once placed in cell, bees will allow a drying period, in which much of the water content in the mixture evaporates, leaving a thick golden honey.</p>
		<p>M: What are the benefits of eating honey?</p>
		<p>D: Raw honey made from local nectar & pollen has great health benefits. There are natural antioxidants in local honey that have been known to reduce symptoms of those who suffer from pollen allergies. </p>
		<p>M: Are there different kinds of honey and if so, how do bees accomplish this?</p>
		<p>D: Honey is all the "same," but there are different sources. The flavor variations come from differing nectar sources like fruit, vegetables, and flowering plants. Bees will produce honey from whatever nectar is flowing at the time (thus whatever is flowering within their range).</p>
		<p>M: What is your favorite way to eat honey?</p>
		<p>D: Right out of the hive. When working one of my hives or doing a wild colony capture, I inevitably get some honey on my gloves or fingers. I like to step aside, lift up my bee veil, and eat the honey right off my fingers! My second favorite is eating it over my wife's home-made country biscuits.</p>
		<p>M: What are your suggestions for a person interested in becoming a beekeeper?</p>
		<p>D: Find a local beekeeper and mentor. You will learn much from their knowledge, success, and mistakes.</p>
		<p>Thank you, Dixie, for helping me to learn more about one of my favorite foods and the processes behind it!</p>
		<h1>Making the Queen Bee</h1>
		<p>One very interesting fact about beekeeping is that you can actually make your own queen. There are a few reasons behind making a queen. One, a queen may need to be replaced--a hive could have an old or evil queen and may need to have a new queen introduced to avoid the hive abandoning their honeycomb. Another is that some beekeepers choose to create new hives once an old hive becomes to large. To do so they need to introduce a queen to the swarm.</p>
